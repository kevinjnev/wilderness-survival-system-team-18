# wilderness-survival-system-team-18
For CS3560 Object Oriented Design and Programming. This team project involves getting a player character to the other side of a map generated by the program. The map is made of squares that drain resources from the player depending on what type of terrain it is, and there are different types of pathfinding that the player uses to cross the map.
